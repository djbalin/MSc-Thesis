20 apr 17:55: Jeg er kommet til at ødelægge den \"clean\"  `count_matchings_vertex_included_multiple`, den som indeholder timing. den giver forkert resultat. fiks det lige.\n","# Resultat fra timingeksperimenter: over 90% af den lange tid bruges i de mange, mange kald til `is_matching`. Jeg tror ikke, at `nx.is_matching` er langsom i sig selv, men den lange tid skyldes, at `powerset` er *ENORMT*! Jeg skaber alle combinations, også selvom subsets af dem er invalid. F.eks., hvis edgesettet {(1,2),(3,4)} ikke er valid, så behøver jeg ikke at undersøge {(1,2),(3,4),(5,6)} osv... fiks dette !"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyNRzvcef27K9EQgo8qmHiiO","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
